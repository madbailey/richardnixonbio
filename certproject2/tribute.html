          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <div class="thickborder"></div>
          <p>
            Welcome to the Richard Nixon tribute page! Richard Nixon was a complex figure who left an indelible mark on American history. In many ways, we can see that we are still living in Richard Nixon's America today. From his intense racial demogougery, to his paranoid style of politics that sought to deepen the political divisions in America, and laundering of a realpolitik foreign policy through domestic culture wars - the strategies he devised as President will be unfamiliar to none. This page will explore the life and career of this central figure, from his complicated relationship with his mother to his resignation in the wake of the Watergate scandal.

          <h2>Pre-Presidency</h2>

            Richard Nixon was born on January 9, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California. He was the second of five children born to Francis Anthony Nixon and Hannah Milhous Nixon. Nixon's father was a lemon farmer and grocer who also dabbled in oil speculation. Nixon's mother was a devout Quaker who instilled in him a strong sense of morality and discipline.

              Nixon's childhood was marked by hardship and tragedy. Two of his brothers died of tuberculosis, and his family struggled financially during the Great Depression. Despite these challenges, Nixon excelled academically and was offered a scholarship to Harvard University. However, he was forced to decline due to his family's financial situation and instead attended Whittier College, where he graduated second in his class.

          <h2>Presidency</h2>

            Nixon's presidency was marked by significant achievements in foreign policy, including the opening of diplomatic relations with China and the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) with the Soviet Union. However, his domestic policies were more controversial, particularly his handling of the Vietnam War and his use of the "Southern Strategy" to appeal to white voters in the South.

              Nixon's presidency ultimately ended in disgrace with the Watergate scandal. In June 1972, five men connected to Nixon's reelection campaign were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. The subsequent investigation revealed a cover-up orchestrated by the White House, and in August 1974, facing almost certain impeachment and removal from office, Nixon resigned.

          <div class="thickborder"></div>
          <p>
            After his resignation, Nixon retired to his home in San Clemente, California. He spent the remainder of his life working to rehabilitate his image and legacy. He wrote several books, including his memoirs, and traveled the world as an elder statesman.

              Nixon's post-presidency was also marked by a series of health problems, including a stroke in 1974 and phlebitis in 1981. He died on April 22, 1994, at the age of 81, and was buried beside his wife Pat at his birthplace in Yorba Linda.
